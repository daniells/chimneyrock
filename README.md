The Mystery of Chimney Rock - The Game
======================================

This project is for making an interactive game from the CYOA classic `The Mystery Of Chimney Rock`, by Edward Packard.

I don't remember what platform I wanted to set up this game in.

[Twine engine](http://twinery.org) looks good to me now, but I was sure I had something more special in mind.  

If it was [TagOS](http://tagos.io) I must have had a cool plan for the app structure.

Maybe if I make this repo look _really_ nice I'll remember.
