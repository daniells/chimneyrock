The Mystery of Chimney Rock - The Game
======================================

This project is for making a game out of the text of the CYOA classic `The Mystery Of Chimney Rock` by Edward Packard.

I don't remember what platform I wanted to set up this game in.

[Twine engine](http://twinery.org) looks good to me now, but I was sure I had something more special in mind.

Maybe if I make this repo look _really_ nice I'll remember.

It was probably Nametag, but again, I have a memory of a special idea I was excited about.  If it _was_ TagOS I must have had a cool idea for the app structure.
